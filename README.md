## Abstract
Applying deep learning (DL) techniques in the electronic design automation (EDA) field has become a trending topic in recent years. Most existing solutions apply well-developed DL models to solve specific EDA problems. While demonstrating promising results, they require careful model tuning for every problem. The fundamental question on *"How to obtain a general and effective neural representation of circuits?"* has not been answered yet. In this work, we take the first step towards solving this problem. We propose *DeepGate*, a novel representation learning solution that effectively embeds both logic function and structural information of a circuit as vectors on each gate. Specifically, we propose transforming circuits into unified and-inverter graph format for learning and using signal probabilities as the supervision task in DeepGate. We then introduce a novel graph neural network that uses strong inductive biases in practical circuits as learning priors for signal probability prediction. Our experimental results show the efficacy and generalization capability of DeepGate.


## Installation
The experiments are conducted on Linux, with Python version 3.7.4, PyTorch version 1.8.1, and [Pytorch Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric) version 2.0.1.

To set up the environment:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/cure-lab/DeepGate.git
cd deepgate
conda create -n deepgate python=3.7.4
conda activate deepgate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Prepare dataset
Please refer to [`DATASETS.md`](DATASETS.md) for the preparation of the dataset files.

## Running training code
To train the DeepGate,
```sh
cd src
python main.py [--args]
```
For settings of experiments, run the scripts in directory `./experiments/prob/`. For example: 
```sh
bash ./experiments/prob/recgnn_deepgate.sh
```
## Run evaluation code
Run `test.sh`  in directory `./experiments/prob/`.


## Test point insertion
After training the DeepGate model, we can apply it for the downstream task: **test point insertion**. We provide a separate directory `./tpi` for this task. Please read [`./tpi/README.md`](tpi/README.md) first. More details about how to run the TPI will be coming soon.
